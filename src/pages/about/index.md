The Masks Now Coalition was founded when hundreds of Americans acting individually to make three-layer masks and raise our country’s viral resistance to the spread of coronavirus got together to make an umbrella organization. 

Led by nineteen organizers directing over 1000 volunteers who banded together in response to the urgent national shortage in personal protective equipment (PPE) brought on by the novel coronavirus outbreak in America, The Masks Now Coalition has volunteers in every state, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico ready to answer the call from over 125 hospitals in 28 states which have made public appeals for homesewn masks.

Mask makers, a physician, logistics and IT experts, creators, former federal officials and artists converged quickly to form The Masks Now Coalition under the umbrella of the Democratic Coalition, a national political advocacy group.

Our goal is to give each citizen the ability to take control of their community’s public health by making homemade masks for patients in order to conserve the manufactured masks that protect our irreplaceable healthcare workers and doctors.
